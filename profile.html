			<div class="opaque"><font class="title">Mannerisms: </font>Shinpei has a tendency to scratch his scalp or his skin when under pressure, perhaps as an attempt to seem unaffected.

			<div class="opaque left"><font class="title">Zanpakuto Spirit: </font>Douji manifests as a young boy of blonde hair. He stands about four feet tall and skips everywhere he goes. He has dimples when he smiles (constantly) and talks with childish mannerisms. His actual age is uncertain, but physically he seems like a mortal child of about eight.<br>Douji is uncharacteristically friendly for a Zanpakutou spirit; accounts from the Academy inform that he often actively tried to engage other sword spirits in camraderie or discussion--rarely with any success. Shinpei's reaction to this seems to have been a negative one. At the least, his relationship with Shinpei is probably severely handicapped. Even when using his sword, Shinpei has never once been seen to call Douji's name or ask for his assistance. It seems a great deal like there's a wall between the two.</div>
			<div class="opaque image"><div id="douji"><div class="text">Just look at that smug little shit. Yap yap yap yap yap.</div></div></div>
			<div class="opaque response">I don't see you hanging around with a spirit that likes yapping in your ear non-stop. And thanks but no thanks for reminding me about the Academy. Sheesh, Douji was the worst there. Explains why I don't talk to him now. And his name is 童子, by the way.</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="opaque left"><font class="title">Inner World: </font>Information on Douji's inner world is surprisingly easy to come by considering how often he's invited other spirits by. Most report it as an endless set of tatami rooms, each one different in theme and structure than the last. Douji, additionally, seems to hold no preference for rooms, instead preferring to meet each newcomer in a different locale. Some rooms mentioned include a karaoke bar, rock climbing gym and padded prison cell. Reportedly, windows and doorways that seem to lead to a beautiful landscape (when a room calls for it) beyond are revealed to be instead extremely detailed wallpaper.</div>
			<div class="opaque image"><div id="world"><div class="text">If you thought that was a real tree, you are sorely mistaken. Unless it's a tree growing in the room. Sometimes that happens.</div></div></div>
			<div class="opaque response">Oh yes, Douji's House of Excitement. My favorite's the titty bar. Don't tell my family I said that. Actually, do.</div>

		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="opaque left"><font class="title">Zanpakuto Appearance (Constant Release): </font>Shinpei's Zanpakuto is hardly remarkable, except for the red binding and red tassel. Besides that the sword is simply a standard issue katana, no different from the Academy training weapons: no inscription, no design, no visible chips or cracks or scratches. Just a simple blade, hand guard, hilt and black-lacquered sheath. Perhaps the only remarkable thing about the sword is that it doesn't change appearance in its Shikai form, though the point is minor given the Shikai is a constant-release type. Shinpei carries it loosely in the sash of his obi, one hand perpetually resting on the hilt. He professes this is the "most comfortable" posture for him to take.</div>
			<div class="opaque image"><div id="appearance"><div class="text">Dull, dull, dull. Well, not the edge. That's pretty sharp. But you know what I mean.</div></div></div>
			<div class="opaque response">That's okay, you can come out and say it: it's boring. I was hoping for something with a little more pizzazz, myself.</div>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="opaque left"><font class="title">Shikai Abilities </font>Douji's power is appropriate for one as childish as himself. He seems to place all combatants in a state of invulnerability: all attacks made simply phase through flesh or bone like they weren't there. The only way this can be broken is by, with every attack, divulging something about oneself that no one has ever heard before. An unknown secret.<br>Few have seen this power manifested, mostly because Shinpei is loath to trouble himself with combat.</div>
			<div class="opaque image"><div id="power"><div class="text">See what I mean? Would you want to live with this guy in your head?</div></div></div>
			<div class="opaque response">"Grow, Douji!" You can imagine how rarely I bother saying that.
			He's super picky about the power, too. No trash secrets like "I stole a piece of candy when I was five." It has to be something he'd find interesting.</div>

				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">"You know what the difference is between you and me, Shun?"<br /> "Discipline?"<br /> "Focus. You can handle doing a hundred things at once. Me, I have a one-track mind."</div>
					<div id="mind" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">Call me 'Mr. Train,' because I only run on one track. Actually, don't call me that. It's a dumb name.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Shinpei was not a precocious child; he was satisfied simply by acting his age. He loved the wide open views of the Rukongai and the way the hills rolled or the forests swayed. He didn't talk or read until quite late in his childhood--a stark contrast to his elder brother Shun. In fact he was quite distanced from his family with one exception: his twin sister, Ayame. They played, slept, ate and read together. Inseparable doesn't cut it; more like it was difficult to tell where one ended and the other began. Of course, that sort of behavior didn't last forever; if biology doesn't separate the genders then society is sure to.</p>
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">"Mom says we shouldn't take baths together anymore," Shinpei mumbled. He kicked at a pebble, face downcast.<br /> "Why?" Ayame looked up at her brother but found no answer there.<br /> "Dunno. We just can't."<br /> "...One more time?"<br />Shinpei hesitated, but she was making the puppy-dog eyes. He hated those as much as he knew they were effective. "Fine. One more time. Come on, we can play save-the-ducky."</div>
					<div id="kids" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">Don't laugh. Save-the-ducky is a strenuous sport.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>At an appropriate age the two were gently separated. Shinpei knew from experience his father's capability for wrath if disobeyed, but Ayame had difficulty acclimating at first. It was lonely for her--lonely for both of them--but that was simply the way of the world. With age comes change. Even the Shinigami can't escape that. And so, for a time, a rift opened up between them. Misplaced animosity bloomed; both blamed the other for the sudden increase in distance. From closest allies they had gone to bitterest enemies. And it was long years before that changed.</p>
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">Shinpei had seen a man acting out a piece of swordform, and the act had highly appealed to him. It awoke something like a vague sense of chivalric passion in him and heated his blood.<br /> So he stood in the gardens practicing pieces of the strange art with a long stick he'd split from a branch. It lay on his hip and then swung out once, again. It returned.<br /> It took a long time for him to notice his sister was watching. When their eyes met he stopped, and they stared.<br /> Neither was sure quite what to say.</div>
					<div id="stick" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">Don't be alarmed: I switched to a bokken soon, like in the photo. What, were you thinking I was just grabbing these pictures willy-nilly?</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>An unlikely event reunited the two, now teenagers: a piece of practiced swordplay that Shinpei had picked up from a traveling samurai. To Shinpei the strike was part of a fuller art form; to Ayame, it was perfection itself.<br /> After many sessions of wordless practice, Ayame brought a book to show her brother: an old manual describing what would become the art of Iado, of a single katana strike from the sheath. Ayame begged him to continue practicing that single strike and Shinpei knew better than to try to resist. She always got her way, it just sometimes took a little longer.</p>
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">"And this is how you hold the scabbard," Ayame pointed out with a gleam in her eye. "You draw it like--are you listening, Shicchan?"<br /> The use of his pet name brought Shinpei out of his broodings. "Yeah, yeah. You were telling me about the draw, right?"<br /> He tuned her out again, watching as she pantomimed the action. He was thinking that some of his friends had called her pretty, and he was remembering the young age it was customary to marry at in the Rukongai.<br /> She was a woman, he guessed, just like he was sort of a man. Maybe some of his friends would be seeking her hand soon.<br /> He couldn't help but think the two of them were about to get very far away again.</div>
					<div id="reading" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">I made it pretty clear that if anyone made my sister cry, they'd be late. As in, late people. You know, dead.</div>
					</div> 
				</div>
				<p>Marriage offers did start coming, but their parents weren't the type to force a union and Ayame never seemed that interested. She didn't mind playing with them occasionally--there were still sparks of the tomboy she'd once been--but she had embraced the lessons of feminine propriety; she was growing up into a proper young woman indeed. Shinpei too was changing: by his father's discretion he had been given a tutor in swordform who was pleased to find such single-minded determination in the young man. However, he never took to anything besides that single strike's art, and finally the tutor realized he was better off polishing than forcing new material. In this way he trained for fifty years, until the tutor resigned. He had nothing more to teach.<br /> It was good timing. Their family at that time began to face great strife--or perhaps it's better to say they always had and only now was Shinpei aware of it. Life in the Rukongai was hard; in a world of constant disappearance, appearance and tumult there were few who could brag of keeping a unit--even a family--together and in good health. His parents did an admirable job making every penny count but soon they were broke and soon after that, deep in debt. This was hard on Shun but harder on his father, who blamed himself for the recent downturn in their family fortunes. In fact it was no one's fault; "living" was always expensive and in the wake of several devastating Hollow attacks on the Rukongai--perhaps due to the currently-raging Hundred Years' War--it had only become more so. The Minamoto family was lucky simply not to be targeted. When the attacks ended Shun and their father were relieved. Shinpei and Ayame were angry.</p> 
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">"I hate it," they both said at the same time. They caught each other's eyes and laughed. Moments like these were common.<br /> "The Seireitei is powerful, right?" Ayame asked.<br /> "Undoubtedly. But they didn't lift a finger to help."<br /> "Why should they be the ones ruling?"<br /> "Luck?" Shinpei mused, half-seriously.<br /> Ayame grabbed him by the collar and glared at him, but he just stared back. Her grip was weak. Maybe one of them was crying.<br /> "I hate them," she finally said.<br /> "I know."</div>
					<div id="necktie" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">She had a way with words. No joke here; pack it up, folks.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Fifty more years passed. Shinpei grew into more of the man he would eventually become: as the Minamoto grew in influence and as they regained their footing many people came calling to Shinpei. He was the obvious person to curry favor with: his parents were too wise to fall for such obvious tricks, Shun was too staid and rigid, Yui too unpredictable, Mei too experienced. He and Ayame weathered their fair share of friends and those pretending to be allies, each in their own way: Ayame learned to keep others at arm's length and Shinpei simply didn't care. He embraced the abundance of friends that came his way and didn't bemoan their eventual departing; others would always come running. His flippant attitude drew yet more followers, curious how he could be so self-secure, especially from the fairer sex. These suitors he treated with the same attitude, quickly dispelling any hopes his mother might have had about a good match.<br /> It was troubling for the family, even distressing. If things went too far, he could find himself in a life-long hole with no shovel. They saw a future of destitution and bastard children. The family tried without luck to convince him to give up his ways, but when they failed they sent Ayame to plead with him. She was the only one who had any traction with him.</p>  
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">"Mom and Dad say you should stop carousing."<br /> He looked back at her, and grinned. "Don't you mean 'sleeping around?' "<br /> "You're actually sleeping with them? God, you're stupider than I thought."<br /> "Hey, that's no fair. I hear you're popular with the guys too."<br /> Her eyes shot to the floor. "That's... that's different. We don't... I wouldn't ever..."<br /> "Good."<br /> "Good?"<br /> "A woman's purity is an important thing."<br /> "Sexist."<br /> "Try 'realist.' "<br /> It was hard to stay mad at each other for long.</div>
					<div id="argument" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">Peas in a pod, right? Right. I think. Maybe I don't know what that metaphor means.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>His visitors dwindled, then disappeared. He stopped carousing. His relationships with women gained a little more distance, though every now and then he'd slip up. Someone in the family would hear about it, and Ayame would go running off to chew him out. The family's standing wavered, but did not tarnish completely, though Shinpei couldn't have cared less. He didn't mind their standing so much. He was simply comfortable the way it was. But it didn't last forever.</p>
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">Shun and Shinpei had never been close, per se, but even then the brothers knew enough to see some of what the other was feeling. So when that fateful day they passed each other in the hall, Shinpei caught Shun by his shoulder and stopped him.<br /> "Hey, Shun. What happened? You look pale as a ghost."<br /> Shun looked slowly to his brother, gears clearly still turning. Only then did Shinpei notice the sword at Shun's side.<br /> "Is that..."<br /> Shun didn't have to answer, and he kept on walking, head in the clouds, when Shinpei retreated.<br /> Both brothers knew what it would mean.</div>
					<div id="brother" class="flashback">
						<div class="text">There's my brother, moping. "Oh no, I have a sword! Whatever shall I do?"</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>It didn't take long for the summons to come, and that night was the busiest the Minamoto family had ever seen. Junpei called a rare family meeting so every voice could be heard, but no one seemed in opposition of the move. How could they? Life in the Seireitei meant safety, power, money, fame. It meant a path upwards and forwards, and security from the Hollows and other disasters that haunted the Rukongai. It meant no roving gangs, no starving spiritually capable, no strife. No disappearances. No vying for land. No lack of medicine. Who could disagree? The family came to an agreement within hours.<br /> An agreement, that is, minus one. Ayame could not be found.<br /> They didn't know she'd run away from home until Shinpei found the note she'd left on her dresser. He clutched it close as he led a wide-ranging search that lasted two days and two nights. They never found a trace.<br /> The family couldn't delay. They accepted the offer and presented a ome reward--though they'd have to sell a great deal to match it--should anyone find their lost daughter.<br /> Then it was to the Academy.</p>  
				<div class="comparison">
					<div class="memory">Shun was the second last to leave the search. He watched as Shinpei crumpled the note and ground it into the mud, crushing it until it was no longer recognizable. All that was left was the imprint of what Shinpei had read off it: "I'm sorry. Goodbye."<br /> Shinpei's foot mashed it deeper and deeper into the wet ground.<br /> Shun placed his hand on Shinpei's shoulder. The gesture of compassion fstion from his brother was more than Shinpei was used to and it made his breath catch.<br /> "I'm sorry. I know you knew her best."<br /> "I thought I did. Maybe I could have predicted this." The poison in his brother's voice made Shun wince.<br /> "Come on back. We'll try again tomorrow."<br /> "Right," Shinpei said. "We'll find her tomorrow."<br /> By the end of those three days he would have slept a total of five hours.</div>

		<div class="historyExpand" id="middleHistory"><h3>LOSS AND LONELINESS</h3>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class="memory">"Minamoto. Minamoto? SHINPEI!"<br />Shinpei slowly, lazily came awake. "Present," he echoed sleepily.<br />"Bad timing. I just asked you a question. Attendance was taken ten minutes ago."<br />"Oh." The Shinigami-in-training sounded genuinely surprised. His brother winced and sought his attention to convey the answer, but their eyes never met.<br />"I asked you: 'what is the nature of the relationship between Shinigami and Zanpakuto?"<br />"Hmm, hard question. What do you think, Star Student? You've got one, after all."<br />Shun's patience was at an end. "Why don't you apply yourself for once?" He hissed. "You're smarter than this."<br />Shinpei grinned. "What's in it for me?"</div>
				<div id="sleeping" class="flashback">
					<div class="text">I don't think Shun likes me very much. That's okay; the feeling's mutual.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>His family hoped the change of scenery would do good for Shinpei, considering how morose he'd become since his twin's disappearance. In fact it did him a world of good, but the recovery was a very slow process. The isolation he imposed on himself during the first few weeks of the Academy won him no friends and certainly no admirers; he was a little bit of an outcast, in contrast to his well-liked siblings. Shun especially had gained a great deal of prestige by being the only one in the school to have manifested his Zanpakuto--though of course, he didn't know how to ply his fame.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class="memory">"Listen," Shun tried, "You and I have a responsibility. We're more than just Shinpei and Shun here, you understand?"<br />"Oh yeah?" Shinpei answered. By now he knew it was simpler to just hear his brother out.<br />"Of course. We're the face of the Minamoto family, here. We decide how others perceive us in entirety."<br />"You don't say." A group of girls had come sweeping by, noticed Shun and were now giggling and shooting glances his way. Shinpei moved out from behind him. "He's single, but he doesn't like whispers." They scurried away upon seeing the disfavored brother, and Shun turned on him.<br />"What was that all about?"<br />"Never mind. You were saying something about a family?"<br />Shun's temper neared its end. "Listen, you and our siblings, we can't let down our family--"<br />Shinpei's anger flared to meet his. "I don't give a damn about how we look. I don't intend to keep myself from doing what I enjoy, no matter what the consequences."</div>
				<div id="conflict" class="flashback">
					<div class="text">See why? If he stopped saying shit like that, maybe we'd get along.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>Shinpei was a disappointment. In school and out of it, he was far below the norm: no friends, no social life, no interests, and no attempts to perform well in school. Word of it reached home, but none of his family had the slightest clue what to do about him. Shun had become the closest to him after their midnight searches, but even he was only perfunctorily near. Of the people who knew Shinpei's heart, there were none left living. He continued to spiral down, and down, and down, and down, until...</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class="memory">"I'm here. What do you want?"<br />The boys laughed. "Isn't that obvious? We're tired of you lording it over us just because you got your Zanpakuto a while ago. We thought to teach you a lesson."<br />Shun's eyes darted around. No escape. Six assailants. Some of them with Zanpakuto, now, and some with simple blades. "I will not hesitate to defend myself."<br />"Good luck," the leader scoffed. "You're top of the class, but you can't take us all on."<br />Shun's eyes narrowed. "Did you wait until my older sister was away, so you could take me on alone?"<br />"Get real. Even if we did, it's not like we had to be scared. Your entire family is gutter trash."<br />"Say that again," Shun growled.<br />"They won't," came a voice from behind the would-be-attackers. A blade speared through the leader's stomach, then retracted. No blood. The man vomited. The men ran, wild-eyed with fear.<br />"Shinpei?" His brother was waving a sword back and forth, more well-defined and well-balanced than the empty blade it had grown from.<br />"I stand up for my family."<br />"Your Zanpakuto... you knew it couldn't cut?"<br />"Must be faulty. I was planning on cutting him open."</div>
				<div id="sword" class="flashback">
					<div class="text">Knife to meet you! Actually it should be "Katana to meet you," but that doesn't sound as good.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>By that time, it wasn't surprising for Shinpei to have manifested his Zanpakuto. In fact, he was somewhere around the last half to do so, but on that day his personality changed a great deal. His introverted tendencies became extroverted; he became a social creature very unlike his older brother. People started to regard him well. He was no longer a burden to the family name.<br />His family, of course, was delighted by the sudden change, but they weren't quite sure what had brought it on and Shinpei made no effort to be transparent.<br />Slowly, painstakingly, he began to regain a following like the one he'd enjoyed in the Rukongai. First one girl began to flirt with him, then two, then five. Shun had little interest in these kinds of salacious women, but Shinpei took to them like a duck to water. He enjoyed flirting a great deal, and his peers found he was even quite good at it. Still, Shun's throne--though he didn't care for it, or perhaps because of that--was never shaken. Shinpei didn't care. If the women were only associating with him to get to his brother, what should he care? A few of them ended up falling in bed with him anyway.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class="memory">"And the right way to combat a Byakurai is...?"<br />"Get out of the way."<br />The class laughed. Shinpei smirked. The teacher was not pleased.<br />"Very funny, Minamoto. Keep that up and I'll have to..." Shun's hand was raised. "Have to..." his hand remained aloft. "Yes, what is it?"<br />"Technically, teacher, isn't that answer correct? As we learned in the last week's lesson, the first step to overcoming an opponent is not being hit."<br />The teacher gnashed his teeth. "Technically, yes, I suppose, but--"<br />"Were you asking how best to <font id="normal">deflect</font> a Byakurai spell?"<br />"Yes, exactly. As I was saying..."<br />Shinpei blew a kiss Shun's way, but his brother just sighed and shook his head.<br />At least he was paying attention now.</div>

			<p>Come graduation, nearly every teacher was surprised to find Shinpei was one of the graduating class. Given his wretched performance the first half of his schooling, some were shocked to find him still attending at all. However, it all checked out: his grades were, if not perfect, acceptable; his skill in Kido was, if not proficient, existent; his marks in swordsmanship were outstanding.<br />This was perhaps the most surprising thing about Shinpei to teachers, peers and his family alike. They had been expecting yet another subpar performance when the time came for inter-Shinigami battle; a ranking would be produced for posterity's sake and for the families to gloat over.<br />Shinpei was second in the men's division. Shun was first.</p>
			<div class="comparison">	
				<div class="memory">"And... fight!" The procter retreated from the arena's center, expecting to be hit with every manner of poorly controlled Kido spell. Instead, he was met with silence.<br />"Is it over now?" Shinpei sounded bored. His sword was out. It was at his opponent's neck.<br />The other Shinigami hadn't even drawn his blade.<br />There was complete silence in the stands. Some students who had already lost their matches had heard of Shinpei's skill and come to watch. Not one had seen his blade move.<br />"And... the winner is Shinpei Minamoto!"<br />"Next," Shinpei called. He left his blade out.<br />"Next is... your own brother. Shun Minamoto!"<br />"Pass."<br />"What?"<br />"Boring. I quit." He sheathed his sword, and he left the arena.<br />The stands were still silent.</div>
				<div id="sheathe" class="flashback">
					<div class="text">Here you were thinking I was pretty lame, right? Nope, I'm the coolest. Just ask anyone with a set of tits.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>This above all was the event that elevated Shinpei's popularity to a level akin to his brother's. His incredible speed and skill with his Zanpakuto combined with his flippant nature made it seem as if he'd been talented all along, and when his peers heard of his refusal to fight his brother they interpreted it as evidence of an unbreakable family bond. In fact he'd meant what he'd said: fighting his own brother would be boring. He simply had no reason to do so: no motivation. Unlike his brother he was just fine with being second best. He didn't mind it so much.<br />When graduation came, he was in a perfect spot to begin his new life just as he'd dreamed.</p>

		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"Are you still mad at the Seireitei, now that we're part of it?" Sayuri asked in one of the few, precious moments she'd been able to snatch with her youngest son.<br />"Come on mother," he laughed. "I'm older and wiser than that now. Besides, that was more Ayame's thing, you know? You should know your children better."<br />Sayuri flushed but managed to hold her tongue. She'd spent too long at odds with her family to fall to such an obvious bait. "Now that we can really grant it to you, what do you want?"<br />"What do I want?" He tapped at his nose like it was the first time he'd really considered the question.<br />"You've always been a loner, Shinpei. If there's anything you want, let us know. Family should help each other."<br />Shinpei laughed. "Bless you, mother. No, the thing I want you couldn't grant to me anyway."<br />"And that is?" She probed, feeling very close to some chance of connection with her distant son.<br />He folded his  behind his head and leaned back. "Just to have fun. By the way, do we have any extra pillows lying around?"</div>
			<div id="mother" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">Would you want to have a mother that looked half your age?</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>The new digs, he decided, were wonderful. The house was easily ten times the size of their previous living space and there was even a good bit of grassy land that smelled of potential. Shinpei set about converting a small plot into a garden full of flowers. After that he turned his attention to his room, which was promptly turned into a luxurious living space with cushions on one side of the room and a huge, canopy bed on the other. The only decoration he put up on the wall was a huge, calligraphy poster proclaiming "LOVE." His family didn't quite understand until they saw just who he'd be bringing home.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"Listen," Shun said, "can I come in for a minute?" He looked past his brother to see a moving, fleshy mass. Only on second inspection could he seperate them into individuals. "On second thought, better not."<br />"Yeah, probably better if you stay out here," Shinpei chuckled, not bothering to fix his unbuttoned shirt or his tousled hair. "What's on your mind?"<br />"...just how many women do you have in there?"<br />"Good question." Shinpei turned his head and yelled. "Hey, how many of you are there?"<br />Amidst giggles and several conflicting answers came the final number: 9. "Nine," Shinpei relayed nonchalantly back to his brother.<br />"I can hear. In fact, that's--" a load moan echoed down the corridor, making Shun blush and Shinpei scratch his nose. "That's what I'm here about. The whole house can hear. Why don't you tone it down, alright?"<br />After a moment of thought, Shinpei nodded. "I'll install some more insulation tomorrow." Then he closed the door. Muffled, from behind it: "Who missed me?"<br />They all did.</div>
			<div id="chest" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">Shame Shun is so stuck up. If only he'd turned out good, like me.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Again Shinpei commanded a kind of following from the people around him, and that number had only grown with the Minamoto's meteoric rise. See, people tend to instinctively know talent or luck when they see it, and it was practically dripping off the Minamoto family. Again women plied their hand at currying favor with Shinpei, but their male counterparts found decidedly less face success with Mei, who was less willing to string them along than Ayame had been. In comparison the women found a new tool at their disposal in Shinpei's freely-expressed sexuality. All manner tried (and try) their hand at rising in his eyes, but none have lasted more than a month or so before he grows tired of them. Whether a suitor denies him or leads him on or gives herself to him freely, it makes no difference in his estimation. Oh, he'll chase, but not for too long. He says too much of a chase is boring.<br />Shinpei comes from a place of great plenty. This attitude makes him seem impervious and only increases his suitors' desire to be the one who cracks him wide open. Even a man made of stone can be worn down: that's the ardent hope, anyway.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"I can't believe you'd do this to me!" The shrill cry pierced Shun's ears and wrinkled his brow. When he pulled open the screen door, the sight was as predictable as could be.<br />"What's so hard to believe?" Shinpei stood half-naked, pants barely on and hair ruffled. He swept a hand through it without much effect.<br />Across the hall from him quivered a disheveled but pretty woman holding her clothes to her naked body. She was crying. "You can't expect me to believe you're 'bored' with me after all I did!" She sounded more like she was trying to convince herself than the playboy scratching his nose.<br />"That's all there is to it," came the cool reply.<br />"But... I did so much! I gave myself to you, and I even let you--"<br />"Ahem," interjected Shun, no longer willing to be a silent observer. The girl noticed him, then her state of undress, then blushed scarlet and ran from the house amidst sobs.<br />"Thanks," sighed his brother. "She got really annoying. Should have known." He made to turn around and head back, but found Shun's hand clamped tight on his shoulder.<br />"She was crying. You hurt her. For what?"<br />Shinpei simply flicked the hand away. There was no real strength in it; he would never give an answer. As brothers, both knew this. "She knew what she was getting into."<br />He slid back into his room, and soft noises weren't far behind.</div>
			<div id="naked" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">I wonder if my dear brother knows what a woman looks like under her clothes.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>At first his parents were stunned by this slovenly and crude behavior. Neither had any idea how to tackle it but when a studious use of silent treatment failed Junpei cornered his son. Though odd in mannerism, he had carefully never fallen out of favor with his father; the clear self-possesion and lack of need for reassurement had won him a low place in Junpei's heart. This was the first time the two had clashed on any major issue and Junpei found to his surprise an ocean of icy contempt in his son. Though he levied all the resources at his disposal--estrangement, silence, threats--he could not make Shinpei budge an inch. The patriarch of the family, so recently and cordially "deposed" by his eldest son, realized his powerlessness and gave up. From that moment forward the family simply decided to pretend Shinpei's perverse ways did not exist. It was easiest.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">Shinpei flopped on his back, spreading his weight along the pillows on his floor and the various occupants lying in them. Several shifted under him. One asked: "something bothering you, Shicchan?"<br />"Don't call me that," Shinpei groaned and flipped over, finding his cheek on something warm and fleshy. Maybe a buttock or a side; he toyed with rubbing his cheek along it to find out but soon grew bored.<br />"Sure thing, Shin-chan. That better?"<br />He opened his eyes and squinted. Buttock. Definitely. "Much. No, I don't think it will bother me ever again."<br />A murmur of approval spread through the throng. They were glad: their patron was happy. All was right with the world.<br />A hand snaked out and found his sash after a long moment of silence. Shinpei chuckled. "You girls are utterly instatiable, do you know that?"<br />He helped them undo it. "That's okay, though. It's why you're so perfect."</div>
			<div id="pillows" title="Too lewd? Well, you were the one who asked.">  <img class="bottom" src="http://i.imgur.com/k0PRtuX.png"/>  <img class="top" src="http://i.imgur.com/KVAcimc.png" /></div>
		</div>
		<p>It wasn't the end of their schemes to find a more wholesome outlet for the youngest son, however; something siblings and parents alike strove to address. The first attempt was obvious: with Shun in a Division elevating the family name it seemed obvious that Shinpei would follow--and indeed, he did let himself get pressured into the First for a short time. He was later kicked right out for "laziness and lack of respect." When prompted he replied that life in a Division was far too tedious and too busy. He had more important things to do--at least, that's what he said. The truth of this was unclear and for a time, his family monitored him closely to find out what exactly he got up to. All they found were these four repeated actions: some days Shinpei would go walking in the Seireitei, meeting people (mostly women) and often teasing them (always women), sometimes in public and always a bit scandalously. He had no male friends--indeed, the only men he ever deigned to repeatedly associate with were in his extended or close family--and rarely enough did that include his father. Instead he preferred the company of women, often loose but always willing to fawn over him. The rest he simply had no interest in.<br>After an afternoon spent in town (when did he ever rise before noon?) Shinpei would return with several beautiful girls in tow. The dumb ones followed easily. The smart ones listened to the warnings about him. The ones who thought they were smart tended to think they would find a different result than all the rest. They never did.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"Listen," the girl insisted. "I'm not like everyone else. You can't just charm your way into my... my..."<br />"Your?" Shinpei queried, pulling his lips away from her neck.<br />"I was... you can't charm your way into mine." She looked up to see his eyes sparkling.<br />"A nice bit of wordplay. You've made me just a little excited with that, you know. It showed your intelligence."<br />"It... it did?" His mouth was moving down to her shoulder in a decidedly more hungry fashion. "I heard you liked... a different kind of girl."<br />"Like what? All breasts, no brains? Nothing could be farther from the truth. I didn't single you out because of that."<br />"Hey..." she protested weakly. "Are you saying I'm not pretty enough?"<br />"Absolutely not."<br />"Absolutely not, I'm not, or... oh. Or... the other one."<br />"Let me show you."</div>
			<div id="kiss" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">Can you guess what I showed her? You get three guesses, and the first two don't count.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Shinpei would linger only long enough to grab drinks and snacks--and the promises of more from whatever hapless servants happened to be nearby--then made a beeline to his own chambers. Not much could be heard from a room or two away, but the contents could be guessed. Several of his family checked just to be sure all was as it seemed, and let me tell you--it certainly was. They never doubted it again.<br />After several hours of play, Shinpei would either fall asleep in the arms of his harem or kick them out for privacy. Some nights he preferred to sleep alone; it was unpredictable but inevitable. Only the newest girls took it personally, and if they left for good--well, he wouldn't go chasing after them, that was for sure.<br>When neither in town nor in his chambers, Shinpei could be found gardening in the moments between one thing and the next. Over the years his modest garden had grown to cover almost a quarter of an acre and took at least an hour's worth of maintenance every day. It was the only thing of his he wouldn't let the hired help take care of; he called it his "little project" and disliked visitors or talk while he worked. His proclivity for gardening was the most noteworthy aspect of him, many women seemed to think, but whenever it was mentioned Shinpei merely brushed it off and laughed. Flowers, he claimed, "weren't really for him." He just "needed something else to do sometimes." His dismissal of the work only increased its intrigue and some women seized on this small crack in his features. They never got far.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"Everyone asks at some point," Shinpei sighed. There was silence for a moment as he regarded a nearby rosebush. "You could call it my sister's grave, I guess. She liked flowers and we never really found her body, so it's something to remember her by."<br />"O-oh." The woman--he'd already forgotten her name--stumbled over her words. "I'm so sorry, I didn't realize--"<br />"Yeah. Run off. I'm bored with you."<br />One short altercation later, Shun walked over to find his brother massaging a swollen cheek.<br />"Hard hit?" He asked, seeing the stinging red handprint only beginning to fade.<br />"No kidding. I'll have to have some of my other girls kiss the pain awa--"<br />"Stop it. Just stop." Shun gritted his teeth, trying to convey the frustration and disappointment he felt. "Listen, I know we didn't always see eye-to-eye, but I knew you before we came here and you were never like... like this." He waved a hand at the retreating, sobbing, woman.<br />"You didn't," Shinpei said calmly. "You don't. You won't ever."<br />He walked off in the direction of his chambers, and Shun knew better than to try stop him.</div>
			<div id="flowers" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">No bitches get between me and my flowers. Truth.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Of particular interest was the fourth habit Shinpei turned out to have: late at night, his watchers found, the Minamoto's youngest son slipped free from his harem's arms and stood outside on the grass, Zanpakuto in its sheath. In one fluid, lightning-fast movement he would draw it and then replace it in the scabbard. And again. And again. And again. Often for several hours each night.<br />Rather than the look of concentration on Shun's or any other Shinigami's training face, Shinpei's expression simply seemed... elsewhere. Like the action itself was so boring he couldn't be bothered to focus on it, but he was doing it anyway to stave off listlessness. Or perhaps, to rid himself of any lasting nervous energy the day had generated.<br />However, despite this constant training Shinpei never showed any interest in fighting, whether testing himself against Hollows or other Shinigami. The only time he was seen to raise his sword was when violence was threatened against him--and that never lasted long.</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"You messed around with my girl, man!" The Shinigami whipped his fiery red hair out of his face and spit on the ground between him Shinpei. The Minamoto merely looked at the spot with vague distaste. "Anything to say before I beat the shit out of you?"<br />Shinpei, coming to his senses, shrugged. "She knew what she was getting into. I mean, come on. 'join my harem and we can have some fun together?' I'm not fooling anybody, right?" His brow furrowed. "At least, that was what I said to Miisha. Or was it Haruka? Who was your girl again? I go through an awful lot."<br />Veins bulged on the man's face. "Die!" He screamed, and reached for his sword.<br />"Now now," Shinpei chided, "How are you going to going to cut me without a hand?"<br />"Huh?" The man didn't understand until he tore his sword from his scabbard and it went flying along with the severed hand that still gripped it. He hadn't even seen Shinpei move.<br />"If you couldn't keep your girl, you don't deserve her. Go and get that stitched up. It'll probably still work." He turned away from the man howling in sudden, unexpected pain.<br />That night Shinpei rewarded himself with a few extra girls who'd been charmed--and frightened, of course, but mostly intrigued--by his skilled display. One of them was probably his victim's beau, but if she was he didn't notice.</div>
			<div id="draw" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">Need a hand? Get it? Because I cut his off!</div>
			</div>
		</div>
			<p>AND NOW</p>
		<div class="comparison">
			<div class="memory">"Come on," Shun demanded. "There's more to life than just spending your life in your room screwing random women." He rarely rose his voice or even came that close to cursing. It was easy to tell when he was really angry.<br />"Is there?" Shinpei quipped. "See, my philosophy is to just enjoy what comes. And coming or going are equally pleasurable."<br />"Don't be crude."<br />"Why not? If you see something beautiful, don't you want to keep looking at it? If something is sweet, don't you want more of it? If something feels good, don't you want to do it more?"<br />"You have no consideration for moderation."<br />"Never saw much point in it, honestly. I spent my time in the Rukongai learning how to make much from little. Now there's much all around me. Why make it littler?"</div>
			<div id="pose" class="flashback">
				<div class="text">My eyes are up here, thank you. Keep staring like that and I'll have to charge.</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Shinpei spends most of his time locked up in his rooms enjoying the pleasures of his harem, but when he's not there he can be found in his garden or in the Seireitei proper. If you're a man looking for a mising beau, there's a fair chance she's in his chambers. Just wait a little; he'll be done with her soon and you can have her back. No need to drop by--unless of course you're a woman, in which case the more the merrier. And Shinpei likes being merry.

			<h3>JUNPEI, JUDGEMENTAL FATHER</h3><p>Junpei was not a man who reserved passing judgment, even if his opinions were hidden behind a mask of friendliness. This was something Shinpei and Ayame learned early on: when they did something that displeased their father, they knew it. He would never outright state that he was disappointed in them, but the feeling would be abundantly clear. They got so they could tell his mood by the most subtle twitch of his eyebrows; though he was not a frightening man, his moods were unpredictable unless one paid careful attention.<br><br>This approach worked for some of his siblings, but not for Shinpei. Surely the first time Shun disappointed his father, he vowed "never again." For Shinpei it was something more like "who is he to judge me?"<br><br>Often conflicts between second son and father would arise from this inborn anger--something Shun could not understand and often (fruitlessly) attempted to counsel Shinpei against. Sayuri was always the savior of these tense situations. Before anger turned to violence or ultimatums, she was always there to gently reprimand both and remind them of their places. A father, she'd say, shouldn't yell at his children. And a son should make his father proud. Those words were all Shun needed to pledge his blood, sweat and tears but the words fell deaf on Shinpei's ears.<br><br>And soon, Shinpei was drawing a great deal of shame to the Minamoto name. He was out carousing every night, neglecting his household chores, acting shamefully towards women he was hardly even in a relationship with. He was acting like a spoiled little child and when Junpei's wife couldn't dissuade his son, he called in the little brat to make his feelings amply clear.<br>The talk went amiably enough but turned sour when Junpei, frustrated, voiced his ever-present wish: "why couldn't you be more like your brother?"<br>What Junpei found was a well of distrust and hatred from his son. Even Sayuri's intervention could not stop their shouting match and at the end of it Shinpei went storming out of the house, swearing never to return. Junpei was shocked. What, he wondered, had he done so differently with Shinpei than with Shun? The only blame he could think to put was on Ayame, whose distance from her twin had perhaps caused this shameless behavior. Perhaps, he thought, he just needed a female confidant and that was what caused all this acting out. Twins were meant to be together--their total separation had always confused him, but he had let them handle their own affairs. Now, he decided, it might be time for him to meddle.<br><br>Junpei was pleased initially with the success Ayame found in coaxing her brother back, but soon realized that his personality hadn't changed at all. He was still brash, disrespectful and angry in dealings with his father. Perhaps, he began to wonder, Ayame was the problem and not the solution. He began encouraging the two to spend more and more time apart, with varying success--but still found no permanent change in his son. Shinpei seemed, if anything, determined to act the same around his father as he always had.<br><br>Despite himself, Junpei missed the contact with his second son. He treasured the teacher-student relationship he shared with Shun and wished that the same could exist with Shinpei. He was resigned, however, to the unlikeliness of this possibility, by the time the world changed on them.<br>And oh, how it changed. All for the better.<br>Junpei saw it as the heavens answering his constant, subliminal plea: in one week his family had a chance for shelter, safety, food, and an opportunity to better themselves. He had grown tired of the agelessness of the Rukongai and was aching for something more alive as he himself grew older. This seemed like nothing they could turn down--and why would they?<br><br>Ayame ran. He lost a daughter, though he couldn't have possibly foreseen it. Of course, that didn't stop him from blaming himself. He was determined to shoulder the burdens of his family; he made sure to take upon himself all the blame his wife and children felt. He still remembers her birthday.<br><br>The move to the Seireitei brought much to the family, but it didn't heal his son. Junpei was not without compassion: he understood to give his son space. A part of him wished he could be there to comfort his own offspring, but he knew there was too much bad blood between the two. He thought the school environment of the Academy would be good for his children, but it initially seemed Shinpei was too deeply damaged.<br>Junpei worried for his son every now and then, but he had wisdom enough to know that the trauma would make Shinpei stronger--if he overcame it. And after half of the Academy was over, it seemed just that transpired.<br><br>The distance from his second son had softened his heart and he welcomed Shinpei back with open arms. However, despite the smile on the young man's face, he was closed off. His father watched as he built himself a garden and then a plush room and finally a harem, silently disapproving. However, he didn't have time in the day to be concerned about their reputation. Here, in the Seireitei, he had found the land of opportunity and was determined to secure a spot for his family in the safe haven it represented.<br><br>These days Junpei avoids confronting his second son, but makes no attempts to conceal his disappointment. He plans to set Shinpei right one of these days, but hopes that the young man will come to his senses before his father has to intervene.</p></div>

			<div class="bg">I'm not a child anymore, but sometimes I wish I was.</div>
			<h3>SAYURI, GENTLE MOTHER</h3> <p>Shinpei was no closer to his mother than any of his siblings. In fact, especially compared to Shun's attachment to their parental figures, Shinpei might have been the farthest. Or rather, Shinpei and Ayame together: after all, back then the two were practically joined at the hip. Sayuri was always available to nurse a scraped knee or soothe an outburst of temper, but the twins discovered early on that, though loving, their mother could not be everywhere at once. She did, after all, have more than two children to raise. <br> That suited Shinpei and Ayame just fine. They didn't mind spending time alone--how could they? "Alone" merely meant "the two of us and no one else." They didn't need anyone besides each other... unless, of course, a situation demanded running home to mother.<br><br>When the two began to grow apart, they initially blamed their parents; they seemed, after all, like the antagonizing factor. But it's hard at that young age to stay angry and soon they were just as happy to spend time alone as they were to be found in their mother's lap.<br><br>Of course, that phase didn't last forever either. Shinpei's rebellious teenage years saw him drawing further and further away from the family, becoming more and more involved with friends and followers from different houses or even different villages. Of course, Sayuri was the first to notice her son's distance and was the first to try to coax him back. She tried a great deal: entreatments, gentle punishments, even commands through his father. Despite her efforts, Shinpei seemed determined to leave the nest. It was not a safe time for him to do so; the world outside their doors was getting worse and though their village had been safe so far, there was no reason it should stay unmolested. In desperation Sayuri begged his sister, Ayame, to keep him in the house. It worked, mostly. He stayed inside and they weathered the storm.<br><br>However, their relationship never returned to the naive son-and-mother balance that she still craved. He'd built up a distance between himself and her, and she knew by now not to challenge it head-on. Mei and Shun had followed the same pattern, though the latter not as quickly and sharply. Sayuri accepted the distance between them as a necessary growth and remained ever the available mother, ready to step in to offer her shoulder should he need it.<br><br>Things got bad fast and without warning. In the space of a week the family almost fell apart. The event that set it all up was of course Shun's materialization of his Zanpakuto, quickly followed by the Second Division's investigation and a call for them to join the Soul Society. "With all haste," the emissary said. There seemed to be no downside to the proposal, especially given the comfort the Seireitei offered and the danger the Rukongai perpetually found itself in.<br>Ayame ran, and she was lost. Sayuri was beside herself with grief, but shouldered it so she might comfort her son. He, she knew, would be in a far worse state than she.<br>He rejected her. He almost hit her: she could see it in his eyes. He practically ran all the way to the Academy to join his brother.<br>He was gone.<br>Sayuri cried for a very long time, he'd later hear.<br><br>Sayuri didn't hear much of Shinpei during his first half of the Academy, and what she did hear was bad. Shun made trips back to see his family every weekend, but Shinpei stayed in the dorms with no friends and nothing to do. Sayuri was worried for her son: how could she not be? She tried again and again to reach out to him but received only silence.<br>Then in the space of a few days, she heard, he had become a star. She didn't care about the popularity: hearing of his smile and old habits was enough to reassure her. She thought she would have her son back within the year.<br><br>He didn't come back until graduation day, and at that time Sayuri held herself back from embracing him. There was something about Shinpei at that time that frightened her just a little bit: she half-thought he'd done away with her son and taken his place. He seemed different in all the wrong ways, and yet... he looked happy. That was all she wanted.<br><br>When she saw his dreadful habits reviving, she bit her tongue. She could see the trauma of losing his twin just by looking, and she didn't want to damage the fragile persona he'd set up for himself.<br>At least, she reflected, he was staying at their home now.<br><br>These days Sayuri makes every attempt to steal a moment with her son, just to talk or try to understand. He accepts rarely enough and, when he does, she always comes away feeling just a little farther.</p></div>

			<h3>SHUN, CLUELESS BROTHER</h3><p>Shun's history with his brother is a long one, and that's no surprise: an older brother likes to meddle.<br><br>From the start, Shun was everything Shinpei hated in a sibling. He was nosy, boring, and--worst of all--he kowtowed to their parents to an unbelievable degree. Of course, to Shun he was simply doing what he believed was right. To him, a child following a parent's just orders was the natural state of the world and he never once received an unjust order. His parents were happy. They had a child who looked dependable, strong, and only too willing to uphold their family's honor. It made Shinpei sick, but he wasn't surprised when his older brother's Zanpakutou sprung out of nowhere and wrecked their lives.<br><br>But we're getting ahead of ourselves, aren't we?<br><br>Shun gladly accepted the role of caretaker when his mother and father were too busy. He looked over Shinpei and his sister Ayame, always careful to keep them from getting into trouble. Predictably, he would put an end to their fun.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Come on, come onn!" Ayame was pulling at his sleeve, and Shinpei was vanquished.<br>"Alright, fine. To the top of this big tree?"<br>"Yeah! Let's see who can get to the top first!"<br>A third voice came from behind them. "What are you two planning now?"<br>"Nothing," Shinpei swore.<br>"We're going to climb this tree!" Ayame confessed.<br>Shun looked up... and up... and up. And up. He turned to his younger brother. "That's too tall. You could hurt yourself, or worse: your sister could get hurt."<br>"...I guess." Shinpei nodded, staring at the ground. He knew Shun was right.<br>"Hmph!" Ayame stomped on her twin's foot and went running off.<br>Shinpei went running after her, half hopping, and Shun just sighed. He understood why his parents called the twins a handful.</div>
				<div id='tree' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>It wasn't too long after that when the twins got separated and puberty began. It didn't take a genius to see that Shinpei felt lonely, so Shun reached out to his brother. He introduced him to a group of his friends in the Rukongai, each one of whom looked up to Shun. Shinpei was happy to play with them but began to hate the mention of his brother's name. It was always "Shun this" or "Shun that" or "I wish I was as cool as him" or any other variation. He heard hundreds of them. Shun, when he was present, would just smile. "I'm nothing special," he'd say. "I just have to grow up a little faster than most."<br>Shinpei started to hate that. Several times he tried to leave the group of admirers that had sprung up around his brother, but if he tried to take one of them with him they'd pull back. If they came, they'd wonder where Shun was or what he was up to. He was always Shun's brother, no matter what he did or who he talked to. Everyone seemed to know the eldest son of the Minamoto--if not in person, then by reputation. He was always only an imperfect copy of his brother.<br><br>Eventually, however, Shun's time dried up. He had seen his parents struggling, financially and in management, so he devoted himself to aiding his family. His addition marked a high point in the Minamoto's rise. Shinpei, on the other hand, was all too happy to take control of the friends and admirers his brother had left behind. He learned that by enticing people with mentions of Shun or the possibility they might get to see him--and in all fairness, sometimes they did--he could make them into his own. The more he acted as a stand-in for Shun, the more people began to recognize him for his own merits. And with the boys nearing marrying age, this was a very good thing. Predictably, he took things just a little too far. His father and his mother intervened, but found themselves somehow powerless. Shun was shocked by what his brother had become.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"...And I will never listen to you again." The door burst open. Shinpei went striding from the room, anger etched into his face. Shun caught him by the wrist.<br>"Shinpei, what's going on? Why are you acting like this?" His brother looked at the hand restraining him. Slowly, he raised his eyes. Something in his gaze made Shun let go.<br>"Acting like what? This is who I am." His voice was deadly cold.<br>"I don't understand. Aren't we brothers? Aren't we friends?"<br>"Friends? How could we be <em>friends?</em>" Shinpei stepped forward, forcing his brother to retreat. "You're not a man, you're a machine! You follow orders without question so you can grow up to be <em>just like dad.</em>"<br>"What's wrong with a son growing up like his father?" Shun was getting angry now. His eyes were flinty. "He gave us everything! We're alive right now because of what he's done for us!"<br>The light in Shinpei's eyes flickered. "Out of my way," he commanded. His voice was very calm.<br>"You have to apologize. I won't let you take--"<br>"Move."<br>Maybe Shun saw his brother wouldn't budge. Maybe the command got through to him. Whatever the reason, he did move.<br>The two didn't speak to one another for a long time.</div>
				<div id='move' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>To Shun, the loss of Ayame was at once sad and providential. Of course it created a huge rift in the family--worst of all in Shinpei--but it also represented a chance for him to reconnect with his brother and perhaps, for Shinpei to change his ways. Shun wouldn't have put it that way, of course: he's nothing if not compassionate. The eldest son of the Minamoto family might have said that his middle sister's disappearance was tragic, but might become the catalyst to wrench Shinpei free of his downward spiral. And in fact, it did bring the two brothers closer together. The two spent three full days searching for Ayame; though they didn't talk much, it was more contact than the two had enjoyed for a long time. Maybe a little bit of mutual respect was born. Shun thought to himself "alright, the good was done. We can find her now."<br>But they didn't. You know that already. And Shinpei got worse.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"How is he?" It was the question Shun knew his mother would ask when his own interrogation was done. She loved both her sons. <br>"...I think he's getting better. He was less gloomy this week."<br>Sayuri sighed in relief. "Thank goodness. I get so worried when there's no news and he doesn't come home..."<br>Junpei rested his hand on his wife's shoulder. "We've already lost one child. We don't need to lose another."<br>Shun just nodded. <br>"This means we can keep him in for just a little longer, right?" Sayuri looked expectantly up to her husband, who acceded after a moment of thought.<br>"At least until he takes a turn for the worse."</div>
				<div id='lies' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>Shun lied to his parents for the first time in his life. In fact, he made a habit of it: every weekend when he returned home from the Academy he would smile blandly and say "I think he's doing a little better this week" when asked. In truth, Shinpei wasn't getting any better at all. He was getting worse. Every week saw him slip a little further into isolation and depression. He had no friends, he had no motivation, he had no accomplishments. The rest of their class acted like he wasn't even there--and in truth, he barely was.<br>But Shun knew his parents were worried. The disappearance of their middle daughter had struck a serious blow to their feelings of security and they were waiting with bated breath to snatch Shinpei back into the relative safety of their home should he show any signs of leaving the same way his twin had. It was all they could think about when it came to Shinpei. Shun knew this well; it wasn't like his parents were in the habit of keeping secrets from him. Of course, it wasn't like he was in the habit of lying, either. But he did it anyway.<br>He knew that to repair his relationship with his brother and to keep him afloat, this was the only way.<br>Of course, only one of those dreams ended up bearing fruit.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"You look... happy today," Shun admitted as he watched his brother.<br>"Should I be sad?" Shinpei called back as he tossed item after item in the trash. His room was looking emptier and emptier.<br>"Are you throwing everything away?" A small pillow whizzed past his head.<br>"Just the stuff I was clinging on to." A scroll. A letter. A picture frame. Shun caught the latter. Shinpei and Ayame, posing nonchalantly. Mischief in their eyes.<br>"Are you sure you want to get rid of all this?" They looked happy in the photo.<br>Shinpei gently pried the frame free from his brother's hands. "Live in the present, I always say. Don't worry about yesterday." The frame fell. The glass broke as it hit the pile in the trashcan.<br>"If you say so."<br>"I do."<br>At least his brother looked a little happier.</div>
				<div id='photo' class='flashback' title="No image here. Sorry to dsappoint you."></div>
			</div>
			<p>However, despite Shinpei's better mood, there was no increase in his affection towards his older brother. Shun lamented the loss of the mutual understanding they'd shared, but accepted it as a casualty of the rebirth Shinpei had undergone. At least he was through the tunnel and no longer in danger. At least he wouldn't run away like his sister did.<br>And hey, maybe he even felt a little pride when the two Minamoto boys became the best swordsmen in their Academy class. But he wasn't foolish enough to believe Shinpei would treat his own family any better than he had in the past.<br>The change in his outlook came with a price, one Shun was none too happy about. Being chivalric and knightly in nature, he hated the loose way Shinpei acted towards women--even as much as the man's success confused him. He gave Shinpei space and believed his habits would change in time. Of course, they didn't, but by that time he was too infatuated with Mitsuki to much care.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Why does he do that?" His fiancée asked him as Shinpei snuck yet another girl into his rooms.<br>Shun thought about answering in a number of ways: mentioning the loss of his twin, or the self-imposed isolation, or even his history in the Rukongai. Nothing gave a really satisfying answer. "I don't know," he finally had to admit. "I'm not sure."<br>"I thought you said you knew him best?" Mitsuki gently nudged him in the ribs.<br>"I do. I might be the only one who understands him, now. But he's a hard man to get close to."<br>"Oh? Is he dense, like you?" She snatched a quick kiss on his cheek.<br>"Not nearly." Shun's smile faded. "If anything, he's too aware. If someone tries to get close he pushes them away. Always has, since we were young."<br>"Hmph. He sounds like a loser."<br>"Maybe."<br>"You don't sound like you believe it."<br>"I don't."</div>
				<div id='loser' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>For years, Shinpei was only there peripherally. Shun had a son--had two!--and his influence in the Seireitei grew. He rose to higher and higher ranks, sapping his time with Mitsuki and at home. He didn't realize he was leaving his wife behind until it was too late. His son called for him. He went rushing back.<br>It was impossible to ignore the rumors.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"The two of them... together?" Shun turned the tap and waited for the water to get cold. His wife was burning up on a bed three rooms away. He wanted to be with her.<br>"Lady Mitsuki and the youngest son, right?" Shun froze. The rag in his hands fell on the sink.<br>"Yes, several years ago. Did you notice how his rooms have been empty ever since that?" The servants tittered. "I wonder what it could mean?"<br>"Perhaps he found some fun elsewhere."<br>Shun found it very difficult to breathe. He methodically wet the washcloth, squeezed it mostly dry, turned the tap off. His head was on fire.<br>Slowly, very slowly, he forced himself to be calm. Mitsuki would never betray him like that. Shinpei would never do something so horrific.<br>Would he?</div>
				<div id='rumors' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>She died that evening, but they had enough time for a few words. His children did their best not to cry when he sent them out so he could speak with his wife. He knew they were just outside the door.<br>He didn't want to mention it. He wanted to pretend it was a bad dream. Servants loved rumors; everything they whispered was more than fully false. There was no way anything they'd said had a grain of truth.<br>He wasn't strong enough to banish the doubts completely.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Shinpei..." he asked slowly, falteringly. He didn't know what else to say.<br>She nodded, slow focus coming into her eyes. "Yes... he..."<br>"He... what?" His knuckles were white on the bedside. He wanted so badly to vent his own helpless rage, but had no outlet.<br>"Forgive him." There was a tear in her eye. "He and you... are very alike."<br>"What did he do?" His voice was barely controlled.<br>She didn't speak of it any further. She wouldn't. She died that night.</div>
				<div id='forgiveness' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>Shun did the necessaries. He told his parents. He comforted his children and sent them off to bed. He notified the officials. He watched them take her body.<br>It was very late when he sat at the edge of the porch, watching koi fish sleep in the dark pond behind their mansion.<br>He knew Shinpei's steps without having to look up. He forced himself to be calm: it was all a misunderstanding. That was what he told himself. <br>He wished his brother wouldn't speak.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"I'm sorry."<br>"For?" Shun slowly rose to his feet. His hands were trembling. He didn't know what he'd do.<br>"...didn't she tell you?"<br>Shun turned, rage and hurt burning in his eyes. He no longer saw a brother in front of him: this man had betrayed him.<br>Shinpei looked catatonic. His eyes were looking right past his own brother. They were wide and uncomprehending. "She didn't tell you," he breathed.<br>Shun didn't bother holding himself back any longer. He couldn't. He swung with all his might, right arm leading, muscles screaming. Maybe he was crying.<br>It seemed to Shun that Shinpei was already falling by the time the punch hit him. It sent him, ragdoll-like, all the way to the grass. It tore up the ground and his brother's clothes alike. He looked like a mess, shivering and alone. <br>Shun turned away when his brother began to laugh--sob? He wasn't quite sure--and walked as quickly as he could away from the man he feared had betrayed him. He gave one last parting shot, patience firmly run out.<br>"Don't let me see your face ever again."<br>Shinpei lay there for a long time.</div>
				<div id='sorry' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>These days, the brothers don't interact much. After the wound of his wife's passing began to heal, Shun contented himself with the fact that he would never know exactly what had transpired between his brother and his wife. He trusts Mitsuki implicitly, however--even now--and he knows it must have just been a misunderstanding. It's hard to hate someone you've been the brother of for hundreds of years.<br>Shinpei acts like normal around Shun; a lot of time has passed since then. The two have come to an unspoken understanding.<br>But there's still a wall between them. Maybe there always will be.</p><br></div>
		<div class="familyExpand" id="mitsukiFamily">
			<div class='bg'>Why didn't you ever tell him?</div>
			<h3>MITSUKI, CLOSE CONFIDANT</h3>"So, you're the total pervert I've heard so much about?" A brown-haired, brown-eyed girl was pointing at him from across the hallway, mouth slightly agape.<br>Those were the first words Shinpei ever heard from Mitsuki, the woman that would one day become his brother's wife. It was so crude, so spontaneous. He couldn't help but laugh. <br>He decided straight away that she was a good addition to the family. He could see, even that early, that she and Shun were just a little bit entranced by each other; he knew that look on a woman's face and, well, even so distant he would always know his brother.<br><br>Their marriage and her entry into the Minamoto family was as troubled as could be expected for the low-born/high-born pairing; however, it ultimately succeeded. Shun was respected as a kind of family head in his own right, and if his parents disliked the brazen, low-born woman--a few offhand talks from Shinpei set their minds straight. Purely in passing, you understand. Helping his own brother would be unthinkable, but it wasn't his fault if a conversation steered towards him admitting he liked her spirit.<br>For a playboy like him to compliment anything beyond the physical? That meant a great deal. The complaints dried up. His mother, after all, only wanted what was best for her children. His father learned to live with her--even like her for who she was. Shinpei acceded to his post as "second brother" in the wedding and even managed to smile a little bit. He couldn't help that either.<br><br>For thirty years, the two had peace. Two new children were added to the Minamoto roster: little Jinpei, needy and attention-seeking, and Itsuki with hair and will like fire. The couple was happy, but duty came calling with increasing frequency. Lazy summer days became brief meetings became glimpses of each other became letters became... nothing. Sometimes the children would see him in the halls and come running, only to see his black hair and his thin frame. Not their father at all. They'd run off and Shinpei would frown, scratching his chest and looking absently up at the ceiling. "Thank god," he would reflect, "I don't have any children. Who in their right minds would want that?" He'd walk off to his rooms and the children would go running to their aunts and grandparents. Sayuri especially cherished their attentions: she was reaching an age where the nostalgia of raising her own children had made her just a little wistful. She was more than happy to entertain her grandsons, even if she did have to answer "I don't know" when they asked when their parents would be coming home.<br>What should Shinpei care? They were none of his business.<br><br>Time dragged on. The children grew. Mitsuki came home. Shun didn't.<br>She became just a little bit desperate.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"I'm coming, I'm coming." A chorus of titters from behind him as he picked his way to the door. "For the last time, this is the 'quiet' setting. If you don't like it--"<br>Shinpei stopped short. As he opened the door, he saw not a member of his own family but the tear-streaked face of Mitsuki. "Shun," she said, but that was as far as she could go.<br>Slowly Shinpei nodded. "Everybody, out." They left. What other choice did they have? "What is it?" he asked finally when they were both seated. "Gone again? You knew what you were getting into. Only married to his job."<br>"I... knew, but..." she twisted bunches of her hakama in her fists. "He looks so... happy, when I do see him."<br>Shinpei let out a long sigh and fell back. "I told you. Shun is the kind of man who can't live without a purpose. You helped him find it; it's your own fault as much as his."<br>She started crying. Long, heaving sobs that shook her shoulders. "I know, but... but..."<br>Slowly, Shinpei stood. He sat himself behind her and, hesitantly, began to stroke her hair. "Don't get the wrong idea. This is what my mom and sister used to like when they were feeling sad."<br>Mitsuki slowly relaxed. "No funny business, alright?" There was a sniffle in between her words.<br>"Wouldn't dream of it." If Shinpei's smile became a little sad right then, she couldn't see it.<br>"You keep acting so similar to Shun. It's surprising. Maybe you're not so different after all."<br>"You're not the only person to say that."</div>
				<div id="hair" class="flashback"></div>
			</div>
			<p>Slowly, Mitsuki began to fill up more and more of Shinpei's life. They talked often and long, though debates often became full-blown arguments. Neither of them seemed to mind: both of fiery temperament, even fighting fist-to-fist could easily dissolve into laughter or knowing smiles. They were fiery. They weren't so different. </p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"You're such a... loser!" She swung at him. He sidestepped.<br>"Harpy!" He grinned, easily deflecting another haymaker.<br>"Degenerate!" She kicked, and only barely missed.<br>"Now now, what will it take to stop you?" She chopped.<br>"Nothing!"<br>He grabbed her and held on tight, pinning her arms to the wall. They were very close. He could see right into her eyes.<br>"Hey." She sounded a little subdued. "Didn't you promise no funny business?"<br>"Would I have made a promise like that?"</div>
				<div id="promise" class="flashback"></div>
			</div>
			<p>Rumors began to circulate. Shinpei hadn't visited his harem in weeks: was there someone else he was lusting after? All eyes turned to Mitsuki. The Minamoto name began to fester. Hadn't her husband been gone for many years? Wasn't she lonely in that big house? Alone with that one, you mean--did she give into temptation? Did <i>he</i>? How many of those children are Shun's, anyway? Do you suppose... oh, I... shocking, truly shocking. </p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>Mitsuki, for the most part, didn't care. She was growing old, though Shinpei hadn't really noticed. Her hair had patches of white in brown, now. There were lines on her face. "Old hags will never stop gossiping," she snorted. Still strong-willed. "Besides, I'm turning into one of them."<br>"Never," Shinpei did his best to laugh. He was growing thinner and more depressed by the day, like something heavy was weighing him down. Like he was drowning.<br>"Something wrong?" She slapped him on the back. "I'm not the best hair-stroker, but I can try to cheer you up."<br>"Yeah. There is something you can do for me." He leaned in close. His hands were on her shoulders.<br>"...Shinpei, stop." Her voice was quiet.<br>"I need you to... know. I can't hold it in any longer." He leaned in closer.</div>
				<div id="secret" class="flashback"></div>
			</div>
			<p>Throughout the house, there was silence for a moment. Then, a resounding slap.<br>Mitsuki came running out of his rooms, hand over her mouth. She was crying.<br>Inside that room, a young man was staring at the ceiling with a faint smile on his face. He guessed it was all he could have expected.<br>He leaned back and closed his eyes. He was ready for his life to come to a crashing halt.<br><br>She never spoke of what he'd said or done. She didn't speak to him, either. Not ever again.<br>Soon after that she grew old and died with Shun--home at last!--at her bedside.<br>Shinpei couldn't help but feel just a little bit responsible.<br><br>He found Shun sitting alone, after that. He stood beside him, eyes hollow.<br>They didn't look so different.<br>"I'm sorry," he said.<br><br>Minutes afterwards Shun went walking away, fury written on his face. Shinpei spat the blood out of his mouth and keened, screamed in anguish before curling up as tight as he could.<br>Maybe he wanted to die.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="familyExpand" id="ayameFamily">
			<div class='bg'>I still miss you.</div>
			<h3>AYAME, BELOVED TWIN</h3><p>Ayame is probably the only person Shinpei's ever been truly close to, and no surprise: the two were born mere minutes apart and were hardly separated for years after that.<br>Like most twins, they had a language all their own. Secret handshakes and gestures, codes and secret plans: that sort of thing. The world seemed to them like a huge game, and how lucky to have a great ally right beside you! Back then it was very difficult to tell the two apart; Sayuri was the only one who seemed to have any skill at it but even she sometimes made mistakes.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Ayame!" Junpei barked. "Stop running in the halls. You're disturbing your family."<br>"Ayame?" The child answered, skidding to a stop.<br>"...you are Ayame, aren't you?" Junpei peered closer. "Or are you Shinpei?"<br>"Hmm..." his child pondered, as if the question was a difficult one.<br>"Honey, can I talk to you after you're done with Shinpei?" Sayuri poked her head into the room.<br>"So you are Shinpei!" the father crowed. <br>"Maybe," Ayame grinned.</div>
				<div id='which' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>Since Sayuri and Junpei were both routinely occupied by trying to keep their family life in the Rukongai afloat, some of the raising was done by servants or nannies. This didn't quite work for the twins, who had ideas of their own about what children their age should be doing. On any given day they were climbing up dangerously tall trees, daring each other to hold their breath for as long as possible, or playing hide-and-seek in unfamiliar places. And that was just on the weekdays! They drove anyone watching them insane in a mere matter of days. Between their slipperiness and how difficult it was to tell the two apart, they managed to winnow out of any punishment or scolding either might have earned. Eventually their mother, sighing, realized it was a futile effort to assign anyone at all as their caregiver. She was the only one who could get them to calm down.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"And then," the nanny ranted, "I found them trying to parachute with my apron!"<br>Sayuri hid a giggle behind a cough. "How terrible," she managed, stroking the twins' hair as they lay across her lap.<br>"And that's not the worst of it! They find all manners of millipedes and beetles and they--is this funny to you?"<br>Sayuri couldn't hide it any longer. Her stomach hurt from trying to hold back her laughter.<br>"This family is outrageous! I quit!" the woman screeched and took off. When she turned they could see one last stag beetle crawling up the back of her dress.<br>"You two are such troublemakers, you know that?" She scratched their heads and they settled in comfortably. "But I have a secret to tell you: I was worse at your age." She leaned in close and whispered it.<br>Well, that was that: if they chased off every nanny that came, she'd just have to take care of their rearing herself.<br>The thought was a pleasant one.</div>
				<div id='worse' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>Sayuri did have a great deal more success with the two of them, but that was the furthest they ever got into the family. Mei considered herself above children's play, and Shun was already too wrapped up in the future. He couldn't let himself rest for just a day: he was always looking towards the great walls of the Seireitei and wondering. The very few times he was called in to look after his younger siblings he was always sorely unprepared for their lack of respect and insane activities. He did his best to corral them but often the best he could do is save someone if they fell. Sayuri, of course, was only too ready to rush in with bandages and love. She had to do it fairly often. Yui would have been a great addition to the duo, but she was born just a little too late and even then the kidnapping took her out of commission for many years.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>The twins didn't really understand the concept of "kidnapping." They thought it was just another game, like the ones out of the picture books.<br>"Okay," Ayame commanded from inside the children's play house. "Now you defeat the dragon, but just barely."<br>"Hyaa! Arrgh!" Noises of fake battle came from outside the "castle" and Ayame lay herself down.<br>"Now you break down the front door."<br>"There isn't one."<br>"Pretend!"<br>"Boom, crash!" Shinpei waved his foot through the open space of the play house.<br>"My hero," Ayame read mechanically from the storybook in her hands. "Thank you for saving me from being kidnapped by the dragon. For you, a kiss."<br>"What?" Shinpei froze in his tracks. He hadn't heard anything about there being a kiss, and he was pretty sure they carried cooties.<br>"Mwah!" She grabbed him before he could flee and placed a very small peck on his nose.<br>"Eww." He scrubbed at the spot. "Isn't that supposed to turn me into a frog or something!"<br>"Dummy!" She stuck out her tongue. "Come on, let's go play another game!"</div>
				<div id='frog' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>They didn't really understand what it meant that she was gone, and they didn't fully understand what it meant when she returned, either. They were just glad to have their sister back, even if it was a little disappointing that all she did was cling to their mother. They didn't mind all that much: they could always play on their own.<br>Time passed. The two grew. Puberty showed its first signs, and when the time was appropriate Sayuri stepped in. The two couldn't be inseperable forever, and she knew that if they stayed together permanently they'd never make any friends. There were plenty of interesting people outside their doors, in the Rukongai; many of them already knew their brother Shun, who was something of a regional idol.<br>The twins acquiesced eventually, but it came with a price. Both were convinced that there was something wrong with them alone: otherwise there would have been no reason to be separated. Despite all Sayuri's efforts to convince them otherwise, it created a deep rift between them that lasted for many years.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"I hear you're making a lot of friends in the Rukongai," Sayuri mused. "I'm very glad to hear it. I was worried you'd stay a loner forever."<br>"Yeah, but they're not really my friends, you know? It's Shun's posse." Shinpei groaned and lay back, arm over his eyes.<br>For a while, there was silence.<br>"Hey," he haltingly asked, "how is my si--how's Ayame doing?"<br>Sayuri held back a giggle. How could she tell her son that she'd been asked the same question in reverse only a few hours prior? "She's doing wonderfully. I think she's taking well to the flower arrangement lessons I set up for her. She's growing into a fine, pretty young woman."<br>Shinpei sighed. "Good to hear."<br>"You know," she urged, "it might not hurt to talk to her sometime."<br>"Yeah. Maybe sometime."</div>
				<div id='parallel' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>As fate would have it, their meeting didn't come for another few years. The same time she was gardening, he was practicing a small bit of swordform he'd seen outside their house's walls: a simple draw-and-cut that his sister recognized as Iaido. Infatuated with fantasy and princess stories, she'd learned a great deal about swordsmanship--only in written form, of course--but she knew enough to recognize what he was doing. He caught her staring during the third time she'd come to watch, but neither felt like they could strike up the first conversation. It took several more sessions before they ran into each other on the back porch. Both averted their eyes, not quite sure what to say.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"It's been a long time," Shinpei finally said. He couldn't quite look at her.<br>"Yeah. Sorry." She seemed to be studying the grains in the wood floor.<br>"I'm sorry too." He struggled for more. "I, uh, hear you're growing up well."<br>"I heard the same thing."<br>A long, awkward silence followed. Ayame did her best to break it with a joke.<br>"You miss me a little bit?"<br>Shinpei did his best to look uninterested. He scratched his shoulder lazily before answering. "Nah. You?"<br>Her fingers absentmindedly twirled in her hair. "Nah."<br>The two couldn't keep up the facade for long. They looked up, made eye contact, ran and hugged. They were laughing and giggling for a long time.<br>It was like they'd come home.</div>
				<div id='homecoming' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>They set up Shinpei's room like a dojo, much to the surprise of their parents. They even had a nice little Shomen with red tulips Ayame had grown. None of their family knew they had repaired their relationship, and that was the way they wanted it: a little tiny part inside of them kept saying "if they know, they'll separate us again." Under light of day the fear was easy to extinguish but alone, at night, it was harder to discredit. They could intellectually understand the reason for the distance put between them but emotionally it still felt like a betrayal. <br>Perhaps these feelings drove another wedge between them. After a few years they were apart again: Shinpei was fooling around with random Rukongai girls and Ayame, who couldn't stand her brother's womanizing behavior, distanced herself. It wasn't until Shinpei's behavior caught his parents' attention that the two were brought together one last time.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Listen, Ayame." Her father folded his hands, pondering how best to word his request. "You know something of your twin's behavior?"<br>"His bad habit of jumping every woman he sees?" Her eyes flashed.<br>"That. Your mother and I, as well as Shun, have done our best to convince him against this habit, but he's not in the habit of listening."<br>"Yeah. He's dumb like that." Junpei raised his eyebrows at his daughter's uncharacteristic vehemence against her brother.<br>"We want to ask you to... set him straight. If at all possible."<br>Ayame hesitated. She didn't say anything for a long time.<br>Right as her father was about to speak, she nodded.<br>"I'll do it."</div>
				<div id='confront' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>She didn't really expect her entreatment to work, but somehow it did. More than that, it seemed to banish any last vestiges of the distance between them. They talked for hours, and this time made no real attempts to hide it. They even ran around and played a little bit, just like they had as children.</p>
			<div class="comparison">
				<div class='memory'>"Remember this? You're supposed to come and rescue me." Ayame couldn't fit inside the playhouse anymore, so she was sitting on top of it. She looked a little like a princess.<br>"I do." Shinpei bowed, a grin on his face. "I have defeated the dragon, and claim a kiss on the princess's nose."<br>"Sorry, a kiss on the nose is off-limits for twins." <br>"There's no escape!" He leaned low and placed a very small peck on the top of her foot.<br>"Ew," she murmured. <br>"No frogs?" Shinpei quietly inquired.<br>"A hundred years. We hated each other for a hundred years." She was crying. Maybe he was crying too.<br>"Come on." His voice sounded hoarse, even to him. "Let's play another game."</div>
				<div id='foot' class='flashback'></div>
			</div>
			<p>It didn't last.<br><br>She disappeared a few years later.<br><br>She hasn't been seen since.</p>

		<div class="familyExpand" id="yuiFamily"><div class='bg'>I like your spark.</div><p><h3>YUI, TOMBOY SISTER</h3></p><p>Yui's kidnapping was a very hard time for the Minamoto family. Shinpei had reached the tender age of sixty when she was stolen away from the house, and was just entering adolescence. He saw how his father kept himself harshly controlled, like a tightly-wound toy. He saw how his mother began to fall apart at the seams just a little bit.<br>He was distant enough from his family by this point that it didn't impact him to much of a degree. All he knew was that his parents were sad, and that was enough. He was glad when they found her again.<br><br>Initially, Shinpei regarded his younger sister with a little bit of contempt due to how tightly she clung to her mother in the years following--not that she could be blamed! It simply looked to him like she was duplicating the pattern his other siblings had chosen: suc up to the parents, fall under their sway, be good little children. It was to his surprise and pleasure that Yui turned out to be a tomboy at heart--one who wouldn't follow anyone's orders but her own. Still, the timing was difficult. They seemed to miss each other by circumstance: at her birth and at her kidnapping he was a teenager, hardly willing to involve himself with family. In her adolescence he was away from the house more often than not. They were even separated by a year in the Academy; the first time the two really saw anything of each other was after the Academy, in the Seireitei.<br><br>She didn't like what she saw.<br><br>"What's up with... all this?" She waved a hand in the general direction of his rooms, where soft noises could be heard.<br>"Just as it looks, I'd imagine." He yawned and stretched, shirt coming just a little bit undone. Yui grimaced.<br>"Why?" <br>Shinpei blinked. "You're the first person to ask that, you know?" He scratched the back of his neck. "I guess... it's fun."<br>"Since when were you such a loser?"<br>He grinned. "Always."<br>"No way. You weren't like this when we were young."<br>"Wasn't I? Maybe you just weren't paying attention." His eyes were set. "I've been this way my whole life. If you didn't notice, that's not my fault."<br>Yui gritted her teeth and balled up her fists. <br>"Beating me up won't change me," Shinpei murmured.<br>"Might make me feel better." She spun and walked stiffly away. She knew a lost cause when she saw one.<br>Her brother was only too happy to return to what he was doing.<br><br>These days, Yui avoids her brother until he does something really stupid. Then she's the first one to call him out and berate him. She still believes, just a little bit, that he can be changed. But she's not holding her breath.</p></div>
		<div class="familyExpand" id="junpeiFamily"><div class='bg'>You know nothing.</div><p><h3>JINPEI, NAÏVE NEPHEW</h3></p><p>"You plant those bulbs at least three inches deep, right?" Shinpei stiffened, then forced himself to relax. <br>"You snuck up on me." He spoke without turning his head. "Could it be that you know something about gardening?"<br>"Well, I--"<br>"Or is that what it says on the packet?" Shinpei craned his neck and was rewarded with the lightly grinning face of his oldest nephew, Jinpei.<br>"It also says irises like 'moderate to full sun,' but isn't this kind of a shady spot?" It was true. Half of the day, this spot would be overshadowed by leaves or the manor's roof.<br>"No to both of those questions," Shinpei groaned, and wiped his hands on the damp grass. "This is how I've always done it."<br>"But--"<br>"Listen, flowers don't work by a formula. Sometimes they follow the packet, sometimes they don't. Some seeds I plant end up not sprouting for years. Gardening isn't something in your head. It's something you feel."<br>"I don't understand."<br>"Maybe one day you will."<br><br>All the brains and calm of his father; it wouldn't be a lie to say that Jinpei reminded his uncle of Shun a great deal. However, there was nothing of the fiery passion Shinpei had encountered in Itsuki. Nothing of the flexibility he'd seen in the child's mother. Jinpei seemed more willing to be an impartial observer than any kind of direct actor. It was no surprise that he applied for the Fourth, and it was even less of a surprise when he got in.<br><br>"So, a new recruit as of yesterday? How impressive." Shinpei set his watering can down and began to carefully prune the rose bush in front of him.<br>"That's right." An all-knowing smile was stamped on his nephew's face. He didn't even have to turn around to know that. "At the Fourth."<br>"I guess scientific pursuits--"<br>"Sciental."<br>Shinpei kept snipping. "What?"<br>"Sciental, not scientific. That's the right word to use."<br>"What does that matter?"<br>"What?" Jinpei frowned. He honestly didn't understand what his uncle was getting at. "Being right is important."<br>"<i>Child,</i> being right is <i>nothing.</i> No matter how right you are, correcting people like that will make them hate you." He cut a green leaf by mistake. It had a little bit of brown on it.<br>"Being right is everything!" Jinpei was standing tall, posturing with the self-importance he thought he had. "Being right means you're <i>better</i>."<br>"You're too young. Being happy is far more important than being right."<br>"I don't need to be happy, as long as I can be--"<br>"That's enough." Shinpei's voice was calm as could be. He put down the clippers.<br>"But--"<br>"Leave. Don't come back." Shinpei's hand found its way to his hilt, and his nephew took the hint. He didn't mind too much; someone else would be just as happy to congratulate him.<br>It took a long time for Shinpei to stop trembling.<br><br>These days, the two don't talk. Jinpei stays out of his uncle's hair as much as possible, partly due to concern for the man's unpredictability. To him, Shinpei is a mystery to be solved: the first piece was his reaction and the others might fall into place in the coming days. He's just interested to watch and see.</div>
		<div class="familyExpand" id="itsukiFamily"><div class='bg'>I look forward to seeing you grow.</div><p><h3>ITSUKI, DETERMINED NEPHEW</h3></p><p>"Mom, Dad, why don't you talk to unca Shinpey?"<br>"That's 'Shinpei,' little one." Mitsuki caressed her son's head. <br>"It's... complicated," Shun managed.<br>"He's a loser, you mean," Mitsuki said.<br><br>This was the first Itsuki Minamoto ever heard of Shinpei's debauchery, but the house wasn't quite big enough to hide it forever. He never peeked in on anything directly, but it was hard to miss women (and Shinpei) leaving his room at odd hours, at various stages of undress. He was barely in his teens the first time he confronted his uncle.<br><br>"That's wrong, what you're doing." Despite himself, Shinpei found his lips curving upwards into a smile at the precocious child. He made to walk off, but his nephew blocked his path. Again he reprimanded his elder. This time Shinpei responded with a simple "why?" <br>"Because," came the answer, with a slight blush. But the child gritted his teeth and glared at his uncle with a force that brought another grin to Shinpei's face. His interaction with Shun and Mitsuki's family had been minimal; this much insistence on Itsuki's part showed a remarkable strength of will. He found himself bending down to pat the child on the head, a gesture which he was sure felt infuriating.<br>"Alright," he capitulated. "When you beat me, I'll stop." His nephew grinned.<br>"It's a deal."<br><br>It was too short a time after that when Mitsuki fell ill. It was too short a time until Shun came rushing back, and too short a time before his brother's wife passed away. For the first time, watching his brother and his brother's children grieving, that perhaps he felt a little regretful of the distance between them. But it was something he couldn't change all at once.<br>Shun was distraught at the loss of his wife, but his children were if anything worse off. Itsuki started taking long walks in the estate on his own, and it was there he ran into his uncle again.<br><br>"Sorry," Itsuki mumbled.<br>"For?" His uncle responded.<br>"Don't think I'll be able to beat you. Ever. My mom died and I can't do..." he gritted his teeth. "I can't do anything! I wish I was never born!"<br>Silence reigned, for a while. The carefully maintained flowers swayed in the wind.<br>"You know, I didn't make that proposal out of nowhere," Shinpei finally said.<br>"What?"<br>"I think you might be the only one in your family that could beat me one day. And your powers will come soon."<br>Itsuki grimaced, but some of the fire was back in his eyes. "How can you tell?"<br>"I was like you, once. And you have the same look in your eyes."<br><br>As it happened, the young Minamoto did come into his power--and what a power it was! Among the Shikai powers of the Shinigami, time manipulation was one of the most powerful. Itsuki trained his power for years on end, and when he felt he was ready he confronted his uncle. Shinpei couldn't keep from grinning.<br><br>"I've heard about you," Itsuki grinned. "Fastest draw in the Seireitei, right? So fast your sword can't be seen. Today's the day you get defeated."<br>"You've done your homework." Itsuki's blade was out, but Shinpei's hand was just resting comfortably on his hilt. "Well, are you ready?"<br>"Go." As soon as the words left his lips, Shinpei was moving. As soon as he opened his mouth, Itsuki's Shikai was humming.<br>He focused his eyes. As soon as his uncle's hand gripped his sheath, everything was a blur, but if he focused--there! He could see it!<br>"Seeing isn't enough," Shinpei slurred through the area of sluggish time. "You have to block it too."<br>The blade was at his throat, and the sphere shut off. The sword dropped.<br>"Damn it!" Itsuki stamped the ground, eyes prickling. His uncle felt so far away.<br>But then a hand dropped on his head and ruffled his hair. It reminded him of something his mother used to do.<br>"The first to ever see my blade," Shinpei's voice whispered in his ear. "And one day, the first to block it?"<br><br>These days the two don't come into contact often, but when they do they share a nod of mutual respect. One day, Shinpei knows, his nephew may just overtake him.<br>But not today.</p></div>
		<div class="familyExpand" id="yushioFamily"><div class='bg'>May I one day have more to teach you.</div><p><h3>YUSHIO, TALENTED STUDENT</h3></p><p>Of all the Minamoto family, one young man's aspirations were clear as crystal from day one. Yushio's adoptive mother, Yui, used to joke that he came out of the womb with a sword in his hand.<br>See, Yushio loved swordplay. It's unknown whether his focus was a result of observation or if it was simply coded in his DNA, but from the moment he could reliably hold a stick in both hands he was practicing. And the young boy had talent: among all the Minamoto, perhaps he learned swordplay the quickest. He ate styles up like so much bread. In his fifty years of life he absorbed one discipline after another, learning the ins and outs of a style over many months of practice. More incredibly, he was accelerating. By the time he became interested in Iaido, he had already mastered fifteen arts; the last one had taken him a mere six months.<br><br>To say he became interested in Iaido is a little disengenuous. In fact, his learning that style was an unintended bonus.<br><br>"The little red-headed boy? You mean Yushio." Shinpei's nephew froze by the door. It was slightly cracked: he could see just the outline of his uncle Shinpei lying in bed with some woman.<br>"The bastard, right?" The girl tittered. "How shameful. What was the mother thinking, making a mistake like that." Yushio gritted his teeth, but bore it. This was the first time he'd heard these words, and he hated them.<br>"No clue. Maybe she forgot she wasn't married. Yui's always been forgetful." He hated the humor in his uncle's voice. Was this just a joke to him?<br>The girl sighed. "You'd never do something like that, right?"<br>"Unless it was with the right woman. Now up, up, get dressed."<br>"What? Did I say something?" She sounded close to tears.<br>"I have to deal with a peeping tom. I'll be back in just a moment."<br><br>It wasn't in Yushio to run. He stood proudly, training sword in his belt, outside in the garden. He waited with a stiff back and a fire in his heart. Shinpei, on the other hand, climbed lazily out of his room with his shirt still hanging half-open. It made Yushio grind his teeth.<br><br>"Fix your clothes. It's unseemly."<br>"Weren't you ever taught that eavesdropping was a crime? I'd say that's more unseemly."<br>Yushio unsheathed his blade with a slightly trembling hand and pointed it at his uncle. "As is my right as your nephew, I challenge you for affronting my Mother's honor.<br>Shinpei threw his head back and laughed. "So, you know all about dueling, do you? Then you know it's my call on the form and the rules. I say... first blood is the winner. Katanas."<br>Yushio grinned, despite himself. He'd heard nothing about his uncle besides his debauched habits. Shinpei clucked his tongue.<br>"Are you ready?"<br>"On your mark," the young boy drew his sword, "get set, go--"<br><br>The blood dripped from his shoulder before he felt the cut. Bewildered, his gaze shot from his wound to his uncle. He wasn't even holding his sword! The man's hand was just resting calmly on his hilt, same as before. Yushio braced himself. He had to know! What had just happened? "Again," he commanded, voice shaking slightly.<br>His arm.<br>"Again."<br>His cheek.<br>"Again!"<br>His leg.<br>"AGAIN!"<br>His other arm, his other cheek, his other shoulder, his other leg. This time the blade stayed out: its tip rested over Yushio's heart.<br><br>Shinpei smiled. He could read the anger in his nephew very clearly. It was in the tenseness of his shoulders, in his shallow breathing, in his glare and the set of his teeth. But there was something else in his eyes, too: greed. Or perhaps desire.<br><br>"Want to learn?"<br><br>Of course he did.<br><br>The training was fairly simplistic; it had to be, or Yushio would have surely struggled under the yoke of the man who'd insulted him. All Shinpei did was demonstrate a slow draw to him. Everything would come naturally after that, he said. Then he left the boy to his own devices.<br>He knew natural genius when he saw it.<br><br>A year later, he was challenged yet again. This time he wore something slightly more formal, slightly less loose. He faced his nephew Yushio in the same garden, where the younger had staked out as his own training ground. The two waited, neither sword drawn.<br><br>"On your draw," Shinpei said. By the time he finished speaking, both of their hands were moving. CLANG! The swords met in an explosion of sparks just outside Yushio's scabbard. The younger Minamoto struggled, but was ultimately forced back.<br>"Good," Shinpei nodded. "That's all for the lesson."<br>Stunned, Yushio called after his uncle as the older man sheathed his sword and retreated. "What about the rest of the art? Other moves, a kata?!"<br>"That's enough for now," Shinpei returned. "When you can beat me with a simple technique like that, we'll talk."<br><br>"The garden's yours for practicing--but if you damage the flowers, I'll kill you."<br>It was the end of the last lesson he'd ever receive from Shinpei. Yushio wasn't sure if he was glad or disappointed.<br><br>These days, Yushio can be seen training in Shinpei's garden every now and again. The two regard each other not with conversation but a mutual, earned understanding.</p></div>
